# Database_Design_Project_4
My fourth project in database design, this time without pre-existing data.
Working with a university career center, my group and I were tasked with designing a relational database that holds student data such as contact information, coursework, and qualifications as well as, company openings in the state of North Carolina. This database contains a view, trigger, stored procedure, and what differs from my previous projects is that pre-existing data didn't exist already so, we had to build this database entirely through consultation with the career center and discuss possible attributes that would be useful to include in our database.
